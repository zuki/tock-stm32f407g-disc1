## Chrome OS Roadmap

- TODO: Garret will invite Vadim to present.

## QEMU Testing

- Alistair: Moving to rexpect (expect in Rust) for QEMU testing. PR open.
- Brad: What tests do you see adding? Kernel and userspace?
- Alistair: rexpect is very flexible. Should be able to support any tests.
- Brad: What about user interactive tests?
- Alistair: rexpect will be able to nicely handle that as well.

## PRs

- Phil: Re: one byte reads in OT UART, subtlety there not well documented.
- Brad: Right, callbacks only from interrupt handlers not clear.
- Brad: We did have a thought about using capabilities passed in from the
  interrupt handler.
- Johnathan: This has also appeared in libtock-rs.
